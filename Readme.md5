=========================
SSH Web Proxy 
=========================

Ssh via a http

Provide a web terminal that we can ssh into as a default user and then from there ssh to other nodes with our id 




## Requirements

* Utilize the Docker image or build with Erlang

    Erlang OTP version 24.3.4.10
    rebar3 3.20.0


### Docker Image Build


1. Execute docker build
```sh
 sudo docker image build --force-rm --compress -t sshproxweb:1.0.1 .
```

2. Start docker container
```sh
sudo docker run -d -it --restart unless-stopped -p 8090:8090 --name sshproxyweb \
        -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
        -v "$PWD/config/sshwebproxy.config:/workdir/config/sshwebproxy.config:ro" \
        -v "$PWD/config/vm.args:/opt/local/build/sshproxyweb/_rel/wterm_release/releases/1/vm.args:ro" \
        -v "$PWD/config/sys.config:/opt/local/build/sshproxyweb/_rel/wterm_release/releases/1/sys.config:ro" \
        -v "$PWD/erl:/workdir/erl:rw" \
        ${IMAGE_NAME}
```


## Note 

* Modify conf/vm.args and udpate the **-name**
  e.g -name wterm@your_host_ip

* Add overrides for default configuration file:
  Modify nd update **config/sshwebproxy.config** with your information
  * Note make sure the file is readable by uid 4609 or whatever you changed it to if you modifed Dockerfile



   
Container runs as sshproxweb(4609)
 * Modify the Dockerfile if you want to supply a different id
  
 * Operation
   1. Starts a webserver as the sshproxweb uid within the docker container exposing port 8090
   2. Users can visit the page at http://deployhost:8090
   3. From there they will be in a ssh session and logged into the host via web browser
   4. Currently the initial ssh session is opened with a username and password combination.
      * Todo add support for login via .pem or rsa


## Issues
  * Since certain Ctrl keys are intercepted by the browser directly certain ctrl combinations wont be passed to the 
    underlying ssh session
    i.e ctrl-N will open a new browser window instead of been passed down to ssh session at this time
